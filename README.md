# Custom Luftdaten component for Home Assistant

## Installation
- Create the directory `custom_components/local_luftdaten/` in your Home Assitant config directory (e.g. `~/.homeassistant/custom_components/local_luftdaten/`)
- Download and unzip or clone this repository and move its content to your `local_luftdaten` directory

## Configuration
Create a new sensor entry in your `configuration.yaml` and adjust the host name or the ip address.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: local_luftdaten
    host: 192.168.0.123
    name: Feinstaubsensor
    monitored_conditions:
      - SDS_P1
      - SDS_P2
      - temperature
      - humidity
```

At the moment following sensor data can be read:
- SDS_P1
- SDS_P2
- BME280_temperature
- BME280_humidity
Please open an issue if you want to see other attributes and provide me with a sample of your sensor data by calling `http://192.168.x.y/data.json`.
